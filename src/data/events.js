As the co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Melinda sets the direction and priorities of the world’s largest philanthropy. She is also the founder of Pivotal Ventures, an investment and incubation company working to drive social progress for women and families in the United States. Melinda grew up in Dallas, Texas. She received a bachelor’s degree in computer science from Duke University and an MBA from Duke’s Fuqua School. Melinda spent the first decade of her career developing multimedia products at Microsoft before leaving the company to focus on her family and philanthropic work. She lives in Seattle, Washington with her husband, Bill. They have three children, Jenn, Rory and Phoebe.\nFor the last twenty years, Melinda French Gates has been on a mission. Her goal, as co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, has been to find solutions for people with the most urgent needs, wherever they live. Throughout this journey, one thing has become increasingly clear to her: If you want to lift a society up, invest in women.\nIn The Moment of Lift: How Empowering Women Changes the World, Melinda traces her awakening to the link between women’s empowerment and the health of societies. She shows some of the tremendous opportunities that exist right now to “turbo-charge” change. And she provides simple and effective ways each one of us can make a difference. Convinced that all women should be free to decide whether and when to have children, Melinda took her first step onto the global stage to make a stand for family planning. That step launched her into further efforts: to ensure women everywhere have access to every kind of job; to encourage men around the globe to share equally in the burdens of household work; to advocate for paid family and medical leave for everyone; to eliminate gender bias in all its forms.\nThroughout, Melinda introduces us to her heroes in the movement towards equality, offers startling data, shares moving conversations she’s had with women from all over the world―and shows how we can all get involved.\nA personal statement of passionate conviction, this book tells of Melinda’s journey from a partner working behind the scenes to one of the world’s foremost advocates for women, driven by the belief that no one should be excluded, all lives have equal value, and gender equity is the lever that lifts everything.\nMelinda will be donating all the amounts she receives from this book to charity.\nPhoto Credit: Pivotal Ventures–Jason Bell\nTICKETS $75.00 first three rows* $55.00 orchestra section *$45.00 balcony section *$20.00 balcony (on sale April 7, 10am)*these tickets include the book  \nTicket sales are final.  No refunds.",

We are very excited to be bringing you this event as we are going to gather experts from all over the world to discuss the topic of how to find a job you truly care about.\r\n\r\nIn this program we are going to talk about:\r\nHow to discover your life purpose\r\nHow to educate yourself so that you have the right skillset\r\nHow to put together a resume that will get their HR managers attention\r\nHow to respond to job enquiries with the right email\r\nWhat to do on your interview (things to say and not say)\r\nHow to negotiate your salary\r\n\r\nAnd much more!\r\nWe live in a time where so many people are unhappy with their work and believe this is a great opportunity for individuals to truly find your passion. All too often people become unclear with what it is they are doing and we feel this makes people very sad and depressed.\r\nUnfortunately people were not taught at a young age how to discover your life purpose so we walk around not sure who we are or what to do with your life. This is why we created a career test so that you can take the time to find the clarity you need to create a path towards what you want to do with your life.\r\nWe have many speaking coming from websites such as Monster.com and Indeed.com who will be speaking and offering advice to those individuals who are serious about finding their dream job.

              "text": "In 2018, the band Low will turn twenty-five. Since 1993, Alan Sparhawk and Mimi Parker—the married couple whose heaven-and-earth harmonies have always held the band’s center—have pioneered a subgenre, shrugged off its strictures, recorded a Christmas classic, become a magnetic onstage force, and emerged as one of music’s most steadfast and vital vehicles for pulling light from our darkest emotional recesses. But Low will not commemorate its first quarter-century with mawkish nostalgia or safe runs through songbook favorites. Instead, in faithfully defiant fashion, Low will release its most brazen, abrasive (and, paradoxically, most empowering) album ever: Double Negative, an unflinching eleven-song quest through snarling static and shattering beats that somehow culminates in the brightest pop song of Low’s career.To make Double Negative, Low reenlisted B.J. Burton, the quietly energetic and adventurous producer who has made records with James Blake, Sylvan Esso, and The Tallest Man on Earth in recent years while working as one of the go-to figures at Bon Iver’s home studio, April Base.Burton recorded Low’s last album, 2015’s Ones and Sixes, at April Base, adding might to many of its beats and squelch and frisson beneath many of its melodies.This time, though, Sparhawk, Parker, and bassist Steve Garrington knew they wanted to go further with Burton and his palette of sounds, to see what someone who is, as Sparhawk puts it, “a hip-hop guy” could truly do to their music. Rather than obsessively write and rehearse at home in Duluth, Minnesota, they would often head southeast to Eau Claire, Wisconsin, arriving with sketches and ideas that they would work on for days with Burton. Band and producer became collaborative cowriters, building the pieces up and breaking them down and building them again until their purpose and force felt clear. As the world outside seemed to slide deeper into instability, Low repeated this process for the better part of two years, pondering the results during tours and breaks at home. They considered not only how the fragments fit together but also how, in the United States of 2018, they functioned as statements and salves.Double Negative is, indeed, a record perfectly and painfully suited for our time. Loud and contentious and commanding, Low fights for the world by fighting against it. It begins in pure bedlam, with a beat built from a loop of ruptured noise waging war against the paired voices of Sparhawk and Parker the moment they begin to sing during the massive “Quorum.” For forty minutes, they indulge the battle, trying to be heard amid the noisy grain, sometimes winning and sometimes being tossed toward oblivion. During the immersive “Dancing and Blood,” Parker slowly comes into focus, as if signing from the wind-ripped mouth of a cave. Parker appears to beat back disaster for “Fly,” her soulful vocals curving into and above Garrington’s bold bassline as Sparhawk’s own signal cuts in and out. Elsewhere, though, songs like “Always Trying to Work It Out” and “Tempest” threaten to swallow the pair whole, their overwhelming quakes of dissonance aiming to silence them once and for all. Sometimes, Sparhawk and Parker are stuck in the Sisyphean middle, capable of neither failing nor forging ahead. During the brilliantly conceived “Poor Sucker,” written in large part by Garrington, their voices suggest skiffs stuck on some turbulent sea, falling beneath and rising above the cacophony with seasick irregularity. In this frustrated song of self-defeat, Low lists all the ways they could have made their lives matter. It is a eulogy of could-have-beens for a time that won’t really let you be.As “Rome (Always in the Dark),” a march that forces its way through the din with damn-the-torpedoes tenacity, fades toward a rare silence, a pulse sculpted from a shard of noise emerges, flashing from a distance like the safety of a life raft. It rises into a steady thump, with Sparhawk and Parker floating above it in crystalline unison: “Before it falls into total disarray/You’ll have to learn to live a different way,” they sing, their melody forming a tightrope of despair and delight. In some ways, it’s a warning of the bad times to come. But it’s also a promise that we’re more powerful and adaptable than madness itself, that we have the ability to persevere. During the song’s back half, Sparhawk and Parker don’t say anything. They instead lock into august harmony and glide between notes, Parker’s purely ascendant tone pulling Sparhawk’s falsetto skyward. It is an exquisite and triumphant moment, an exhalation after all the damage and din.In spite of the mounting noise, Sparhawk and Parker still sing. Or maybe they sing because of the noise. For Low, has there ever really been a difference? —Grayson Haver CurrinEMAEMA began with the urge to self-exile. After the success of Past Life Martyred Saints and 2014’s prophetic The Future’s Void, EMA retreated to a basement in Portland, Oregon – a generic apartment complex in a non-trendy neighborhood, with beige carpeting and cheap slat blinds. She returns with a portrait of a world both familiar and alien: Exile in The Outer Ring, a pitch-black world of half-empty subdivisions, American flags hung over basement windows, big-box stores and strip malls and rage. In a year dominated by working-class alienation, EMA — a Midwesterner who has never lost her thousand-yard stare — has delivered an album that renders American poverty and resentment with frightening realism and deep empathy. The Outer Ring is the suburban world of people who’ve been pushed out of city centers by stagnating wages and rising expense, forced up against rural communities swallowed by sprawl. It’s far more diverse than traditional images of “the suburbs” – vape shops and living-room hair salons exist next to Mexican grocery stores and Dollar General. But it’s also more deeply marked by poverty and tension, and by the anger that comes from having your story and your struggles erased from the narrative. An auteur in her own right, EMA has tapped Jacob Portrait of Unknown Mortal Orchestra to co-produce an album that reflects her full range, while also returning, in many respects, to her roots – namely, noise-folk outfit Gowns, and their 2007 album Red State. The result is a deeply personal, confrontational, but ultimately redemptive album from a quintessentially American artist at the peak of her form.",

              "text": "Aviary  is  an  epic  journey  through  what  Julia  Holter  describes  as  “the  cacophony  of  the  mind  in  a  melting  world.”  Out  on  October  26  via  Domino,  it’s  the  Los  Angeles  composer’s  most  breathtakingly  expansive  album  yet,  full  of  startling  turns  and  dazzling  instrumental    arrangements.  The  follow-up  to  her  critically  acclaimed  2015  record,  Have  You  in  My  Wilderness,  it  takes  as  its  starting  point  a  line  from  a  2009  short  story  by  writer  Etel Adnan:  \"I  found  myself  in  an  aviary  full  of  shrieking  birds.\"  It’s  a  scenario  that  sounds  straight  out  of  a  horror  movie,  but  it’s  also  a  pretty  good  metaphor  for  life  in  2018,  with  its  endless  onslaught  of  political  scandals,  freakish  natural  disasters,  and  voices  shouting  their  desires  and  resentments  into  the  void.“Amidst  all  the  internal  and  external  babble  we  experience  daily,  it's  hard  to  find  one's  foundation,”  says  Holter.  “I  think  this  album  is  reflecting  that  feeling  of  cacophony  and  how  one  responds  to  it  as  a  person—how  one  behaves,  how  one  looks  for  love,  for  solace.    Maybe  it’s  a  matter  of  listening  to  and  gathering  the  seeming  madness,  of  forming  something  out  of  it  and  envisioning  a  future.”Fittingly  for  an  album  about  the  chatter  of  the  mind,  most  of  the  songs  on  Aviary  grew  out  of  “cathartic  solo  improvisations”  with  voice  and  synth,  recorded  by  Holter  at  home  throughout  2017.  Where  Wilderness  showcased  her  knack  for  writing  immaculately  constructed  pop  ballads,  she  describes  Aviary  as  an  exercise  in  letting  her  subconscious  show  her  the  way.  “I  was  really  trying  to  have  fun  and  make  a  daring  record.  I  found  myself  drawn  to  certain  things  that  would  happen  when  improvising—surprise  utterances  and  slips.”Holter  then  took  her  favorite  parts  of  the  home  recordings  and  expanded  upon  them,  writing lush  arrangements  for  an  ensemble  of  frequent  collaborators.  In  early  2018,  she  recorded  their  contributions  at  Hollywood’s  Band  House  Studios,  with  executive  producer  Cole  MGN  and  co-producer  Kenny  Gilmore.  Aviary  combines  her  slyly  theatrical  vocals  and  Blade  Runner-inspired  synth  work  with  an  enveloping  palette  of  violin  and  viola  (Dina  Maccabee,  Andrew  Tholl),  double  bass  (Devin  Hoff),  and  percussion  (Corey  Fogel).  Drawing  inspiration  from  the  medieval  world,  she  added  trumpet  and  bagpipes  into  the  mix,  played  by  Sarah  Belle  Reid  and  Tashi  Wada,  respectively.To  evoke  an  overwhelming  swirl  of  voices,  Holter  indulged  her  love  for  wordplay,  often  combining  multiple  languages  and  temporal  tenses  in  a  single  phrase  and  embracing  phonetic  sound  over  meaning.  “Chaitius”  playfully  combines  her  own  words  in  English  with  lyrics  from  a  medieval  Occitan  troubadour  song.  “I  Would  Rather  See”  borrows  its  references  to  chariots  and  steadfast  footsoldiers  from  a  mesostic  poem  she  made  using  an  Anne  Carson  translation  of  Sappho;  “Why  Sad  Song”,  the  album’s  ruefully  meditative  closer,  is  an  English-language  phonetic  translation  of  a  song  by  Nepalese  Buddhist  nun  Choying  Drolma.  But  Aviary  also  elevates  the  “babble”  concept  to  a  compositional  principle.  “A  lot  of  the  songs  play  with  hocketing,  which  is  something  you  have  in  medieval  music,  where  melodies  are  shared  by  different  interrupting  voices,”  says  Holter.    On  Aviary,  we  travel  a  world  populated  by  birds,  angels,  and  ghosts—at  once  characters  in  a  mystery  of  uncertain  denouement  and  a  stand-in  for  the  memories  and  thought-images  that  seem  to  fly  through  the  mind  on  their  own  volition.  Inklings  of  impending  doom  (“Everything  Is  an  Emergency”)  hover  side-by-side  with  ecstatic  professions  of  love  (“Turn  the  Light  On”)  and  moments  of  triumphant  solidarity  (“Voce  Simul”).  Like  other  recent  projects—composing  and  performing  a  live  score  to  Carl  Theodor  Dreyer’s  The  Passion  of  Joan  of  Arc,  as  well  as  arranging  her  album  Tragedy  for  opera,  in  2017—Aviary  sees  Holter  juxtaposing  ancient  and  contemporary  reference  points.  Time  collapses,  with  references  to  the  deep  past—Joan  of  Arc,  the  Christian  Crusades,  the  mass  hysteria  of  the  dance  of  Saint  Vitus—seeming  to  double  as  metaphors  for  our  hopes  and  anxieties  in  the  present.  Jetting  between  medieval  chamber  music  and  proggy  jazz-rock  transports,  plaintive  balladry  and  android  robotics,  it’s  a  journey  full  of  wild  twists  and  turns—but  it’s  one  that  seems  to  cling  to  a  sense  of  radical  hope,  even  in  its  most  somber  moments.Back  in  the  5th  century,  North  African  theologian  Saint  Augustine  envisioned  the  trajectory  of  human  history  in  terms  of  an  ongoing  conflict  between  the  City  of  God  and  the  City  of  Man,  aka  “the  earthly  city.”  As  Thomas  Pinsky  describes  it  in  his  translation  of  Dante’s  Inferno,  the  City  of  Man  “may  also  be  thought  of  as  a  radical  representation  of  the  world  in  which  we  live,  stripped  of  all  temporizing  and  all  hope.\"  When  the  world  you  live  in  starts  to  feel  more  and  more  like  a  hell,  it  can  be  hard  to  know  which  way  to  turn—and  while  it  isn’t  art’s  job  to  show  us  the  way,  what  it  can  do  is  offer  us  glimpses  of  what  defiance  looks  like.  On  “Words  I  Heard,”  a  melodic  standout  full  of  swirling  strings,  it’s  there  in  a  simple  line  of  text:  I  love  you  in  the  City  of  Man.“In  a  lot  of  the  songs,  when  I  mention  love,  it’s  about  a  seeking  for  compassion  and  humility  in  a  world  where  it  feels  like  empathy  is  always  being  tested,”  Holter  says.  In  Aviary’s  case,  that  search  for  sweetness—that  bridging  of  the  gulf—becomes  a  metaphor  for  the  creative  process  itself,  cutting  through  the  hierarchies  of  history,  language,  and  musical  form  to  offer  something  more  fluid,  more  inclusive,  more  idiosyncratic.  “For  a  long  time  in  music,  there  has  been  a  discussion  about  what  ‘dissonance’  and  ‘consonance’  actually  are,”  the  artist  explains.  But  what,  Holter asks, is  the  sound  of  empathy? ",
              "html": "<P>Aviary  is  an  epic  journey  through  what  Julia  Holter  describes  as  “the  cacophony  of  the  mind  in  a  melting  world.”  Out  on  October  26  via  Domino,  it’s  the  Los  Angeles  composer’s  most  breathtakingly  expansive  album  yet,  full  of  startling  turns  and  dazzling  instrumental    arrangements.  The  follow-up  to  her  critically  acclaimed  2015  record,  Have  You  in  My  Wilderness,  it  takes  as  its  starting  point  a  line  from  a  2009  short  story  by  writer  Etel Adnan:  \"I  found  myself  in  an  aviary  full  of  shrieking  birds.\"  It’s  a  scenario  that  sounds  straight  out  of  a  horror  movie,  but  it’s  also  a  pretty  good  metaphor  for  life  in  2018,  with  its  endless  onslaught  of  political  scandals,  freakish  natural  disasters,  and  voices  shouting  their  desires  and  resentments  into  the  void.</P><P>“Amidst  all  the  internal  and  external  babble  we  experience  daily,  it's  hard  to  find  one's  foundation,”  says  Holter.  “I  think  this  album  is  reflecting  that  feeling  of  cacophony  and  how  one  responds  to  it  as  a  person—how  one  behaves,  how  one  looks  for  love,  for  solace.    Maybe  it’s  a  matter  of  listening  to  and  gathering  the  seeming  madness,  of  forming  something  out  of  it  and  envisioning  a  future.”</P><P>Fittingly  for  an  album  about  the  chatter  of  the  mind,  most  of  the  songs  on  Aviary  grew  out  of  “cathartic  solo  improvisations”  with  voice  and  synth,  recorded  by  Holter  at  home  throughout  2017.  Where  Wilderness  showcased  her  knack  for  writing  immaculately  constructed  pop  ballads,  she  describes  Aviary  as  an  exercise  in  letting  her  subconscious  show  her  the  way.  “I  was  really  trying  to  have  fun  and  make  a  daring  record.  I  found  myself  drawn  to  certain  things  that  would  happen  when  improvising—surprise  utterances  and  slips.”</P><P>Holter  then  took  her  favorite  parts  of  the  home  recordings  and  expanded  upon  them,  writing lush  arrangements  for  an  ensemble  of  frequent  collaborators.  In  early  2018,  she  recorded  their  contributions  at  Hollywood’s  Band  House  Studios,  with  executive  producer  Cole  MGN  and  co-producer  Kenny  Gilmore.  Aviary  combines  her  slyly  theatrical  vocals  and  Blade  Runner-inspired  synth  work  with  an  enveloping  palette  of  violin  and  viola  (Dina  Maccabee,  Andrew  Tholl),  double  bass  (Devin  Hoff),  and  percussion  (Corey  Fogel).  Drawing  inspiration  from  the  medieval  world,  she  added  trumpet  and  bagpipes  into  the  mix,  played  by  Sarah  Belle  Reid  and  Tashi  Wada,  respectively.</P><P>To  evoke  an  overwhelming  swirl  of  voices,  Holter  indulged  her  love  for  wordplay,  often  combining  multiple  languages  and  temporal  tenses  in  a  single  phrase  and  embracing  phonetic  sound  over  meaning.  “Chaitius”  playfully  combines  her  own  words  in  English  with  lyrics  from  a  medieval  Occitan  troubadour  song.  “I  Would  Rather  See”  borrows  its  references  to  chariots  and  steadfast  footsoldiers  from  a  mesostic  poem  she  made  using  an  Anne  Carson  translation  of  Sappho;  “Why  Sad  Song”,  the  album’s  ruefully  meditative  closer,  is  an  English-language  phonetic  translation  of  a  song  by  Nepalese  Buddhist  nun  Choying  Drolma.  But  Aviary  also  elevates  the  “babble”  concept  to  a  compositional  principle.  “A  lot  of  the  songs  play  with  hocketing,  which  is  something  you  have  in  medieval  music,  where  melodies  are  shared  by  different  interrupting  voices,”  says  Holter.    </P><P>On  Aviary,  we  travel  a  world  populated  by  birds,  angels,  and  ghosts—at  once  characters  in  a  mystery  of  uncertain  denouement  and  a  stand-in  for  the  memories  and  thought-images  that  seem  to  fly  through  the  mind  on  their  own  volition.  Inklings  of  impending  doom  (“Everything  Is  an  Emergency”)  hover  side-by-side  with  ecstatic  professions  of  love  (“Turn  the  Light  On”)  and  moments  of  triumphant  solidarity  (“Voce  Simul”).  Like  other  recent  projects—composing  and  performing  a  live  score  to  Carl  Theodor  Dreyer’s  The  Passion  of  Joan  of  Arc,  as  well  as  arranging  her  album  Tragedy  for  opera,  in  2017—Aviary  sees  Holter  juxtaposing  ancient  and  contemporary  reference  points.  Time  collapses,  with  references  to  the  deep  past—Joan  of  Arc,  the  Christian  Crusades,  the  mass  hysteria  of  the  dance  of  Saint  Vitus—seeming  to  double  as  metaphors  for  our  hopes  and  anxieties  in  the  present.  Jetting  between  medieval  chamber  music  and  proggy  jazz-rock  transports,  plaintive  balladry  and  android  robotics,  it’s  a  journey  full  of  wild  twists  and  turns—but  it’s  one  that  seems  to  cling  to  a  sense  of  radical  hope,  even  in  its  most  somber  moments.</P><P>Back  in  the  5th  century,  North  African  theologian  Saint  Augustine  envisioned  the  trajectory  of  human  history  in  terms  of  an  ongoing  conflict  between  the  City  of  God  and  the  City  of  Man,  aka  “the  earthly  city.”  As  Thomas  Pinsky  describes  it  in  his  translation  of  Dante’s  Inferno,  the  City  of  Man  “may  also  be  thought  of  as  a  radical  representation  of  the  world  in  which  we  live,  stripped  of  all  temporizing  and  all  hope.\"  When  the  world  you  live  in  starts  to  feel  more  and  more  like  a  hell,  it  can  be  hard  to  know  which  way  to  turn—and  while  it  isn’t  art’s  job  to  show  us  the  way,  what  it  can  do  is  offer  us  glimpses  of  what  defiance  looks  like.

He was appointed last year as chief design officer by Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti. The series this year will be co-sponsored by Occidental and the Mayor’s Office. The kick-off event is sponsored in part by the City of Los Angeles Department of Cultural Affairs.\nThe series begins on March 6 at Barnsdall Gallery Theater, next door to Frank Lloyd Wright’s 1921 Hollyhock House, with a kickoff event entitled Is There an L.A. Sensibility? Place and Politics in Los Angeles Design. Architects, planners, critics and historians often praise works of architecture or urban design for suggesting an authentic sense of place — or knock them for lacking it. But what precisely does it mean for a design — of an apartment building, a park, a Metro line, a bus stop or a 2028 Olympic venue, or even a song or work of art — to reflect the spirit of Los Angeles, or of a specific site or neighborhood in the city? Given the long history of rapid change, displacement and mythmaking in Southern California, these questions can be more fraught and elusive here than in other American cities. What’s more, the effort at so-called placemaking in new project design can run roughshod over community or architectural history, giving rise to a new phrase that many prefer: “placekeeping.” Helping architects, designers, city officials and community leaders frame the question of place in a more nuanced, productive and inclusive way will be Los Angeles City Councilmember Marqueece Harris-Dawson (to discuss the Destination Crenshaw initiative), artists Rosten Woo, Janna Ireland and Ruben Ochoa, architect Frederick Fisher, Helen Leung, Elizabeth Timme, Christopher Torres and others.\nThis event is free and open to the public, registration is required.\n",
